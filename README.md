# Reading notes

This repository contains notes I have taken while reading some books. A habit that I, unfortunately, took too long to adopt.

## Books

- [Python Data Science Handbook](books/python-data-science-handbook) by Jake VanderPlas, 2016.
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](books/hands-on-machine-learning) by Aurélien Géron, 2019.
